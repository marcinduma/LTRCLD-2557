# Nexus Dasboard Orchestrator Tenant configuration 

In this section we will configure our first Tenant, stretched between Azure and AWS. As Cloud Network Controller will be used for configuration, we need to make sure that CNC has privileges to make configuration changes in cloud provider accounts. Will learn how to do it and when we need it. 

Following diagram shows what we are about to configure.

## Tenant Creation on NDO 

On the Left navigation page click **"Application Management" -> "Tenant"** and then **"Add Tenant"**

Associate Tenant to both Sites by checking the checkbox next to it.

!!! Note 
    For now you are not able to **Save** this configuration with red marking on both Sites. Click the **Pencil** button at the end of each site line to complete configuration. 

    Additional setting are needed for CNC, so it knows which subscribtion to use on Azure and which Tenant ID on AWS. 

**CNC-Azure-01 site configuration**

For Azure site, we will be using the same **Subscription** as the one used for CNC deployment - select **Mode** as **"Select Shared"** and use existing subscription from drop-down. Leave security domains empty. Hit **Save**.

**CNC-AWS-01 site configuration**

For AWS site we have 2 options - **Untrusted** with Cloud Access key and Secret or **Trusted**. In our case we would be using **Trusted** configuration. 

Each Tenant created on NDO, associated to AWS Cloud require sepearete Account ID on AWS site. You can find your **AWS User-Account ID** in POD Details. 

Fill in with your POD **AWS User-Account ID** and select **Access Type** as **Trusted**, hit **Save**.

Now configuration can be saved, leave associated user list empty as there are no additional users and hit **Save**.

On the Tenant list you should see **Tenant-01** created an assigned to 2 Sites.

In next step we will make AWS trust configuration, so CNC can make changes to an AWS objects. This step is not needed for Azure, as we are using shared subscription model, so access for CNC to manage Azure components was granted as part of infrastructure configuration. 

You can find details about this process under **Resources** in **Appendixes** section of this Lab Guide.
