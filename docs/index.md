## Cisco support of Public Cloud infrastructure

Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) is a software-defined networking (SDN) solution designed for data centers. Cisco ACI allows network infrastructure to be defined based upon network policies â€“ simplifying, optimizing, and accelerating the application deployment lifecycle. Network Controllers provide more than just a centralized management for networks today. They can also provide a place in the network to deploy network applications to add new capabilities.

The Cisco ACI programmability model provides complete programmatic access. You can integrate network deployment with management and monitoring tools and programmatically deploy new workloads.

Networks have traditionally been built with devices that are designed to be configured and maintained on a per device basis. To make changes or troubleshoot, a network engineer must connect to multiple devices individually and enter commands on the CLI. This solution works fine for mostly static environments, but does not scale and is prone to human error as changes are made more frequently and repetitively. Since the CLI was built for humans, it is less than ideal interface for programmability and automation.
This is the core problem ACI solves for data center operations. ACI's programmability options are made possible through the ACI Object Model.

ACI was built with programmability in mind and designed to be configured and maintained through a central controller via a REST API. This API is how admins interact with the object-model allowing them to create, make changes, gather stats, and troubleshoot the ACI fabric.

During this ACI Automation practice training you will have a chance to explore ACI Object Model and learn how to leverage it for automation in daily operations.

## High Level Design of Lab scenario.

ACI Automation Lab is based on dCloud session publicly available. Session name *Started with Cisco ACI 5.2 v1* can be found in Session catalog at *https://dcloud2-lon.cisco.com/*.

Below is the physical setup of our Virtual lab.
